INSTRUCTIONS: in the terminal, run BoardGames.exe with the second input being "TicTacToe", "Gomoku", or "Sudoku", depending on what you want to play.
Then, follow the instructions on screen to play. Gomoku is essentially Tic Tac Toe, but on a larger board. For Sudoku, there is only one instance available to play.
Example: BoardGames.exe Gomoku  -->  will run Gomoku.
